Instagram bot. Works without Instagram API.

After Instagram [closed the API] (new checkout process), there was a problem: automatically like, comment and subscribe.
This version is a revision to [LevPasha]'s project and [jaguar754's edits] (instabot-py).
By 2021, the implementation of authorization and search for media data objects have become irrelevant.
This version is working correctly.

This InstaBot runs on https://www.instagram.com and only requires your username and password.
